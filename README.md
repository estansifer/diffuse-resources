# Diffuse Resources
a [Factorio](http://factorio.com) mod by Eric Stansifer

Hosted at `https://github.com/estansifer/diffuse-resources/`

This mod causes the base resources (stone, coal, iron, copper) to be mixed and scattered
thinly everywhere.

Every single square of land has either iron, copper, coal, or stone. The typical square has about 30 or so amount of resources in it. The resources are intermixed totally randomly.

 * I changed the graphics of the resource patches so that they are mostly transparent, with the transparency depending on the richness of the square so that you can easily spot the rare multi-thousand resource patches. (Believe me, before I added transparency it was incredibly awful.)

 * You can control the starting densities of resources in the configuration file. This has no effect on a game that has already been started.

 * As your factory grows, you will find yourself needing more or less of various resources. To make balancing easier, I have added a tech tree associated with resource generation. Researching the "More Coal!" technology, for example, makes coal patches 20% more frequent (and the other patches therefore less frequent).

 There is one technology for increasing each of the four resources. If you research all four they will exactly cancel out. You can research the same technology more than once (with no limit to the number of times), but to do so you have to research certain other, fairly expensive technologies to unlock them a second, etc., time.

 * For an extra challenge, see how well you can do using no filter inserters! You can control whether filter inserters are allowed by editing the `config.lua` configuration file. This has the effect of making filter inserters explode the moment they are placed.

 For an extra, extra challenge, play with no filter inserters and combine with the Belt Overflow mod.
